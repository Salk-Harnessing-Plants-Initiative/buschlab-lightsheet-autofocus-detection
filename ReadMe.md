python programm for focus detection for the lightsheet microscope project
takes image stacks and analyses the "best" focus based on 

Normalized Variance (Groen et al., 1985; Yeo et al., 1993)  and  
AutoCorrelation (Vollath, 1987, 1988)

(see F11 and F12 in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jemt.20118/pdf)

gaussian fits are applied.

still uses the whole images as inputs!  
feature detection would be a major improvement
